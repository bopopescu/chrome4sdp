// 2. Start tracking paint invalidation rects
// 3. Call layoutAndPaintAsyncThen (via runRepaintTest, which does this for us) to draw a frame
// 4. Wait longer than 100ms, so that the timer between the first and second animated GIF
//    frame expires and a paint invalidation is issued on the animated GIF. (100ms is the
//    length of the first frame of the animation in the GIF file.)
// 5. Stop tracking paint invalidation rects (finishRepaintTest does this for us)

// These steps differ from a standard repaint test in that step 2 precedes step 3.
// This is critical because layoutAndPaintAsyncThen may take longer than the 100ms of the timer,
// so we may miss it.
